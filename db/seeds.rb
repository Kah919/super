# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# batman = Hero.create(name: "Batman", city: "Gotham", super_powers: "Money")
# spiderman = Hero.create(name: "Spiderman", city: "Queens", super_powers: "Spidey Senses")
#
# joker = Villain.create(name: "Joker", city: "Gotham", super_powers: "Menace", heros_id: batman.id)
# green = Villain.create(name: "Green Golbin", city: "Queens", super_powers: "Bombs", heros_id: spiderman.id)
